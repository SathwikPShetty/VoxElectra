# VoxElectra: ML-Powered Speech Recognition for Electrical Control

## About the Project

"**VoxElectra: ML-Powered Speech Recognition for Electrical Control**" is a project focused on enhancing computers' ability to understand human speech. We are leveraging advanced learning techniques to teach computers how to recognize spoken words and convert them into text, subsequently classifying them into the desired actions.

## Vision/Goal

Harnessing the capabilities of machine learning, the project aims to develop systems that can accurately interpret and transcribe spoken language into text. This text is then used to command electronic devices, thereby automating household appliances.

## Implementation

1. **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Librosa
2. **Speech Recognition Technique**: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)
3. **Models**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
4. **Additional Techniques**: Evaluation metrics, Transfer learning
